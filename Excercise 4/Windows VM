Exercise 4: Windows problem solving

● A short description of your troubleshooting process.

	Getting 503 Exception while browsing the “localhost” because DefaultAppPool wasn’t starting in the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.

● Tell us what's wrong

	The Application pool was configured with Custom account rather than Built-in Identity.

● Explain what you did to fix it

	DafaultAppPool has started after changing the Identity to “ApplicationPoolIdentity” as similar as the other pools.

● Output:

PS C:\Users\bhargava>  Get-IISAppPool "DefaultAppPool"

Name                 Status       CLR Ver  Pipeline Mode  Start Mode
----                 ------       -------  -------------  ----------
